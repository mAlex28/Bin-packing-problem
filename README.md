# Bin-packing-problem
Solving bin packing problem with Simulated Annealing.

This project tries to optimise the bin-packing problem using a single-member algorithm. The task of the given assignment is to use one of the variants of hill climbing, simulated annealing, or tabu search to solve the one-dimensional bin-packing problem. This documentation aims to achieve the minimum number of bins using two approaches: Best Fit + Simulated Annealing and First Fit Decreasing + Simulated Annealing.
